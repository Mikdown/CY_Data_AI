Q: Add a new function that identifies the top-selling product by total 
revenue (price * quantity).

A: A new function, get_top_selling_product, has been added to identify the 
top-selling product by total revenue (price * quantity) in analyzer.py. 
Let me know if you want an example usage or a test for this function.

Q: modify the main block to call this new function and print the result. 
Ensure the output is clearly formatted.

A: The main block now loads sales data from the CSV, calls the new function, 
and prints the top-selling product with clear formatting. The output includes 
the product name, total revenue, and total quantity sold. Let me know if you 
need further adjustments or a test!

result: Total sales from sales_data.csv: $7755.00

Top-Selling Product by Total Revenue:
